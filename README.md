This was a class project, where we designed and implemented a comprehensive data engineering system to analyze COVID-19 incident records and evaluate the impact of lockdown policies. The system aimed to provide actionable insights to policymakers and emergency responders by combining real-time and batch data processing with advanced analytics and visualization. The architecture included:

Apache Kafka: for event brokering and real-time data ingestion.
Hadoop HDFS and Apache Spark: for real-time data preprocessing and cleaning.
Cloud Storage and BigQuery for robust data storage and warehousing.
Looker Studio for interactive dashboards and visualization.
Vertex AI for developing, training, and deploying a machine learning pipeline, leveraging boosted trees for predictive modeling.

All code and processing were executed with Vscode IDE, GCP UI & CLI.
